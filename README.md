# Ford Vehicle Data Backend Service

## Project Overview
This project is part of Ford's initiative to provide drivers with enhanced access to real-time data from their vehicles. Our goal is to create a backend service that bridges the gap between:
- **Mobile Applications**: Used by drivers to view live vehicle data.
- **Embedded Systems**: Hardware in vehicles collecting sensor readings.

The backend will act as the glue, streaming data from vehicle sensors to the mobile app in real-time..

## Project Features
- **Flask Backend**: A Python-based web server to handle data streams.
- **Redis Integration**: An in-memory datastore to efficiently handle live data.
- **Containerization**: Services will be containerized for easy deployment.

## Technologies Used
- **Flask**: Web framework for building the backend service.
- **Redis**: In-memory database for managing real-time data streams.
- **Docker**: Containerization platform for deployment.
- **Python**: Programming language for backend development.
